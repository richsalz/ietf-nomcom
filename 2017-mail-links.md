# Email discussions related to my nomination

The IETF keeps two mail archives of most (all?  I haven't verified) mailing
lists.  The "mail archive" pages are updated immediately, but I can't find a
way to link to individual messages. The "MhonArch" archives give individual
messages but lag by a couple of hours.  I think individual links are more
important, so I'll use MhonArch.  If you visit any of the links below, make
sure to see at the Follow-Ups at the bottom of the page to see if there's
anything more current.
