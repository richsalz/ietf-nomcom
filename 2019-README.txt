# ietf-nomcom-2019

_Creation, 2019-09-24:_
I decided to stand for the IAB.
(I was unsure, but a colleague I respect asked if they could nominate me,
and that pushed me to accept.)
As with [my previous effort](https://github.com/richsalz/ietf-nomcom-2017),
I am doing this as a public repository on GitHub.

Here's a reminder that there there is a mailing list for the process,
[ietf-nomcom](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-nomcom).
Looking at [the archives](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/ietf-nomcom/)
amusingly shows the list to be quiescent since the last time I tried. :)

The 2017 repo lists my concerns and issues about the process, I think they
all still apply, but I will not repeat them here.

The file 2019-questionnaire.txt contains the text of the IAB questionnaire,
which can also be found at
[https://datatracker.ietf.org/nomcom/2019/questionnaires/] at the "IAB Member"
tab.
