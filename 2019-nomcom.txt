Internet Architecture Board (IAB) Member

Questionnaire for IAB Nominees
==================================================================

Please return to nomcom-19@ietf.org no later than October 15,
2019, 23:59 UTC.

This questionnaire is intended to provide the Nominating Committee
with information to help select among nominees for the IAB.

The datatracker tools work best if you submit this in 77-column
pre-wrapped ASCII, a la text/plain.

------------------------------------------------------------------

CONFIDENTIALITY: NOTE that the contents of this questionnaire will
remain absolutely confidential to the nominations committee
process. For IAB nominees, this means that they will be shared
with the NomCom and the ISOC Board of Trustees.

NOTE that there is a section of this questionnaire labeled NOT FOR
CONFIRMING BODY. In the case of the IAB, if you are chosen as a
candidate for the position, the confirming body is the ISOC Board
of Trustees. The section labeled NOT FOR CONFIRMING BODY will not
be provided to the ISOC Board during the confirmation process. You
may tell NomCom things that you wish not to be shared with the
ISOC Board in the NOT FOR CONFIRMING BODY section. It will be kept
absolutely confidential by the nominating committee.

Thank you!

into consideration the desired expertise for the IAB Member
position that can be found at the following url:

2. Experience

I have been a single individual contributor for a few decades. During that
time, I am often working with others to make sure we're satisfying the
requirements of whatever we're working on, while still encouraging creativity
and innovation.  This obviously requires a mix of soft skills, including
encouragement, patient discussion, and the like. The following paragraphs
attempt to call out some particulary relevant experiences over the years.
They are mostly in chronological order.

I used to be a member of the OpenSSL steering committee, known as the OMC,
which is OpenSSL's version of a board. Under my leadership we discussed key
partnerships such as alignment with the Linux Foundation, and searched out and
presented options about 501c3 membership. I also spearheaded efforts to reduce
expenses, such as negotiating with the development staff, cutting needless
expenses such as VOIP phones, and the like.  I was the major force behind the
getting the project to move to the Apache 2 license. I drove the team to adopt
a Code of Conduct.

As an OMC member, I was also part of the small group of people who helped the
project evolve from the shambles of Heartbleed, to the recipient of the
Levchin Prize in 2018, "for dramatic improvements to the code quality of
OpenSSL." (I mention this to show that I can do quality software engineering.)
I have encouraged and mentored developers from Russia, China, and Germany, who
are now official committers to the project.

At one of our post-IETF discussions open to the Akamai technical community,
someone pointed out that the panel consisted of a bunch of white men. At my
urging, we used a portion of our registrations for under-represented
employees.  I mention this to point out that I acknowledge while I am part of
the historic majority, I recognize that I can still improve, and try to help
others (in this case my employer) do so as well.

A few years ago, I got the ietf-hub-boston mailing list created, to server as
a focal point for technical and/or social meetings for people in the Boston
area who participate in the IETF. Our first meetup was a well-attended
retirement party for Scott Bradner (complete with cake); the tentative agenda
for our next meeting includes an introduction to roughtime, and a presentation
by John Klensin on "Does the IETF have a future?"

Since before IETF 101, I have been part of the team revising and presenting
the newcomer's tutorial, including pre-meeting Webinars.  As anyone who has
attended these can confirm, I have been been quite emphatic during slides that
say "be comfortable with who you are" and that "the IETF has a zero-tolerance
policy for harassment."

I have been active in encouraging Russian involvement in the IETF.
There are now more than a half-dozen very active participants, including
the co-leader of the PAKE evaluation group for the CFRG. There is also
a Crypto Review Panel member.

On the business front, in addition to OpenSSL finances, I have been the
President of the Governing Board of my church, over 500 members with a
$750,000 budget.

=============================================================

3. IETF

I think the IETF should be the easiest way for people to collaborate and
design open mechanisms to communicate over the Internet. We have long been
the "best" way, but we are still working on the "easiest" part. This
latter aspect has two parts:
	- Making sure that every possible technical contributor feels that
	they can work within the IETF; and
	- Make sure that they know about us.
The IETF should become almost as well-known as open source -- "we are the open
source foundation for protocols." One possible way of doing this is to 
have a presence at some large OSS-related events.

I think "using GitHub" is an excellent thing. The IETF needs to be where the
developers are. Toward that front, I am an active participant in the WUGH
working group, have drafted some scripts to make integration easier, (at
https://github.com/richsalz/ietf-gh-scripts) and am working on changes to
Datatracker to make it easier to integrate URL's and external identities
between IETF and things like GitHub, Gitlab, etc.  (It wouldn't be a real
software discussion if I didn't mention code that isn't fully implemented
yet.)

I have participated in IASA 2 discussions, have been one of the few outside
of the IETF LLC Board to review all proposed policies, and am participating
in the RSE discussions and meetings.

On and off, since the first Pekka-Kucha at IETF 96, I have raised concerns
about the way Nomcom is picked. To summarize, "using a cryptographically
strong PRNG to choose from a self-selected list does not get representative
membership." Now that IASA is concluding, I would like to see us address this.

=============================================================

4. IAB

I have spoken with a few members of the current IAB. I have full support
from my management to spend the necessary time. Akamai recognizes that the
IETF plays a vital role in the evolution of the open Internet.

I think the IAB needs more involvement. I am not sure how to do that.
I have attended a couple of workshops (MARNEW and ESCAPE), but the
main involvement has been drinking alcohol during the plenary and maintaining
a bad attitude. We should be more than that. One way to help is even
more clarity between the IETF/IESG and the IAB.  I do not have specific
ideas about this yet.

=============================================================

5. Cross Community Collaboration

I hope to continue my involvement with newcomer's tutorials, schedule
permitting. I will stay involved with WUGH. Depending on the venue,
I could (help) present the newcomer's tutorial at other conferences.
I am open to other opportunities as we work on this.

=============================================================

6. Mentoring and Participation

I think we should strongly encourage AD's to always have two WG chairs,
one experienced and one relative newcomer.

I think we should hire a consultant firm to get better feedback on
why people attend, and then stop.  The AMS surveys are okay, but I think
there are professionals who can be more effective.

Logistics are hard. We should think about co-hosting multi-WG interims
with other conferences. We should continue to encourage ACM and others
to have events co-located.

==============================================================

7. Additional Information

I am a very strong believer in transparency. If there is confidential
information, it should be expressed during the interviews.  This
entire questionnaire, as with my previous attempts at Security AD, are on
GitHub at https://github.com/richsalz/ietf-nomcom-2019

==============================================================

8. Additional Information - For NomCom Only

None; this is all public.

END OF SECTION: NOT FOR CONFIRMING BODY
