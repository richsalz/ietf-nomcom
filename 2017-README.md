# ietf-nomcom-2017

_Update, 2017-10-17:_ There is a mailing list for discussing the nomcom
process (I didn't know, but just joined) and my candidacy has sparked some
discussion.  The file
[mailing-list.md](https://github.com/richsalz/ietf-nomcom-2017/blob/master/mail-links.md)
file will be updated with pointers to
individual messages.

_Update, 2017-10-12:_ 2017 questionnaire responses now posted.

I am standing for the position of Security Area co-Director of the IETF.
The [expertise required](https://datatracker.ietf.org/nomcom/2017/expertise/)
page lists all positions; see the Expertise.txt file in this repo for
description of the Security AD requirements.

Most importantly, I intend to put my answers here, and will do check-ins
as I draft it.  I will read issues and review any pull requests :)
I consider this an experiment in "full transparency."  When I accepted my
self-nomination, I put a link to this repo in the acceptance form.

I think the way the IETF fills its leadership positions needs some (small)
modifications.  This is my third look at shaking things up.  Not that you
asked, but the previous "things" were:

- NomCom being randomly selected from self-selected pool does not guarantee
any kind of diversity.  I first talked about this at the
[first Pekkakucha](http://snaggletooth.akam.ai/Berlin-videos/); you have
to click "Next" to get to mine.

- In 2016 I got the standard "please don't tell anyone until we make a
public notice" email.  I asked if I could ask all the other contestants, and
on the basis of those who responded "it wasn't me" I could then make a
public post about who the likely winner was.  On the basis of that, they
fixed the wording for the notification. :)

- At my debriefing meeting, I suggested that someone, perhaps the IETF
Chair, perhaps one or more others, should be able to appoint one or more
people to NomCom, with the goal of increasing diversity.  We chatted
for a couple of minutes about that.

I don't yet know where or how to follow-up on these things, but once I do,
I will.

The file 2016-nomcomm.txt is my questionnaire responses from last year.
This will probably be my starting point for the new questionnaire;
according to [this email](https://datatracker.ietf.org/nomcom/ann/95060/) it
will be available on September 5, and the deadline is October 13.  I will
post a copy of it to this repo as well, and encourage people to provide
feedback for future NomCom's.
