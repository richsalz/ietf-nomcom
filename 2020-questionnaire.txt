IETF Chair Questionnaire
=============================================================================

Please return to nomcom-20@ietf.org no later than October 13, 2020, 23:59 UTC.

This questionnaire is intended to provide the Nominating Committee
with information to help select among nominees for the IETF Chair.

The datatracker tools work best if you submit this in 77-column
pre-wrapped ASCII, a la text/plain.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONFIDENTIALITY: NOTE that the contents of this questionnaire will
remain absolutely confidential to the nominations committee process.
For the IETF Chair, this means that it will be shared with the NomCom and
with the confirming body, which is the currently sitting IAB.

IMPORTANT: There is a section of this questionnaire labeled NOT FOR
CONFIRMING BODY. You may elect to write some information that will not be
shared with the confirming body. It will be kept absolutely confidential by
the nominating committee.

When multiple questions are asked within a numbered block, you may wish to
provide a single answer that responds to that range of questions.

Thank you!

>2. EXPERIENCE AND LEADERSHIP

>Please explain your current experience related to the job

>management training or experience. (Including: soft skills,
>management training, conflict resolution, leadership,
>inter-cultural, setting and implementing long-term strategic

I have mostly been an individual contributor in software development.  During
this time, I have often had interns that I was responsible for; I took time
to give them useful projects and experience and act as a mentor.

As a senior individual contributor, I often have to convince product
management or colleagues to agree to my proposals. Since I am a peer, or
lower down in the management chain, I could never just order something to be
done. This also holds true for when I am the technical lead, working with
programming peers. This involves negotiating, explaining the business case or
potential upside, and the like.

I have often been part of important customer briefings, where I have to draw
a line giving just the necessary disclosure. I had to be an engaging and
forthright speaker. I am good at it. In various start-ups I was usually one
of the prime technical people brought in to prove our competence.  (This
happened again, just yesterday.)

I have had many sessions of management training, conflict resolution, project
management, and the like. Many years ago at the Open Software Foundation
this type of thing was central because the industry sponsors had all the money
and development resources, and we had to work to get them to work together.

For several years I served on the Board of Directors of my church, including
one year as President. Here we dealt with personnel issues, budget concerns
(i.e., there was never enough pledge money), and things like conducting a
search for a new minister.

During the time I was part of the OpenSSL leadership, I tended to focus on
the project infrastructure and non-cryptographic coding. By cleaning out old
defects, re-organizing the website, and implementing things like standard
ways of doing CI and code reviews, I helped moved OpenSSL from the fiasco of
HeartBleed, to winner of the Levchin Prize just a few years later.  I also
led the work to get the source code relicensed under the Apache license; as
an example of transparency, you can see documentation on that at
https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/categories/license/  Finally, to show my
awareness of non-profit issues, I led the work to determine if OpenSSL should
become a part of the Linux Foundation, the Internet Software Collaborative,
Apache Foundation, etc.

As Truman says, "it is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who
gets the credit."  I have experienced this first hand with my best managers,
and I have lived it with my professional and personal life.  I feel most
fulfilled, and the system works best, when everyone involved can do their
best job.

=============================================================================

>3. Diversity

>Please explain your thoughts on diversity. How would you suggest
>increasing diversity in the IETF community (including leadership
>positions), in the context of the position you are running for?
>Describe experience you have in working on diverse teams.

The first principal of my faith is that we believe in "The inherent worth and
dignity of every person." We are a unique and varied species, and we
sometimes forget that we have more in common than not. One of the things that
is becoming more common is use of the Internet. The IETF should strive to be
more representative of the world. While I have problems with RFC 8890, it
presents an excellent statement. Sadly, right now the IETF often looks more
like a colonial empire than something like the UN.

For a long time, Akamai has quietly been working to make its staff more
diverse; since the start of the unrest around Mr. Floyd, we have been more
public in that. Before Akamai, IBM was a leading employer and force for
diversity and respect.  I have worked on diverse teams for a long time,
including race, gender, and others, and it's great. I've recently been able
to listen in on discussions about abused populations and the impact of some
software and it was an eye-opener.

I made a very small pull request to OpenSSL that changed to more inclusive
language; https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/12089.  After much
dicussion, the project decided to vote. After the PR was voted down, I left
the project because I could not be a part of something that did not hold
those values. I currently work on it to meet only Akamai's needs, but frankly
my heart isn't in it and I can't wait to be completely done.

=============================================================================

>4. IETF

>How can the value of the IETF to internal and broader technical
>community be improved (please comment on culture, operations, or
>other topics)?

The mission statement is an accurate description of what we should be doing.
We need to make sure that anyone with an interesting idea for an Internet
protocol will feel welcome to bring it forward, and continue to feel welcome
even if their idea has already been considered and dropped. Working on that
last part is hard, and perhaps requires more soft skills than many in our
industry have. It is also exacerbated by email (to say nothing of social
media alternative), and it would be good to talk about what to do.

Another part of the problem is easier. We need to make sure that the IETF is
broadly known, and the first thing someone thinks about when thinking about
Internet protocols and operations.

(Further discussion below in 5.3)

There are also tactical things that need to be addressed, such as managing the
RFC process, determining if there is language we should be avoiding, and so
on. When and how to meet directly is probably a mix of tactical and strategic.

=============================================================================

>5. IETF Chair

>5.1 Please explain your understanding and ability to support the work
>load and travel associated with the position. Since IETF chair is 
>effectively a full-time position, do you expect to have secured
>funding for the duration of the term? 

Yes. I have spoken with Alissa about the travel she used to do before the
lockdowns. I then contacted people I know who regularly attend those
meetings, and got information about the length and venue. From that, and
using my previous travel as a guide, I prepared a very rough cost estimate.
My management fully supports my nomination, and will fund the travel.  A
snapshot of the worksheet is available at
https://github.com/richsalz/ietf-nomcom/blob/main/2020-travel.pdf. It is
interesting to think about how we can remove this potential barrier to
leadership participation, which is why I am making it available.

Akamai gets indirect value were I to become the Chair. Akamai does better
when the Internet does better. We have a history of investing in projects
that don't directly contribute to our bottom line, including the funding
of TLS 1.3 with OpenSSL, and being a founding sponsor of LetsEncrypt.
Akamai has no agenda or designs on the IETF, and knows we all do best
when we collaborate.

>5.2 Explain the value you will bring to the role and how it will help
>enhance the mission of the IETF.

I bring an understanding of how the IETF works. Previously, I have also been
involved with other SDO's, including W3C, OASIS, and OMG, so I know how they
work and am able to compare and contrast. My involvement in these,
particularly for W3C and OASIS, was driven by the need to implement the
standards in commercially-succesful products. I am not a professional
standards person, I am an implementor who needs standards to succeed.

I bring an understanding of what it means to be a respectful and inclusive
person, knowing that I am a privileged member of society.  I probably hold
the official record for apologizing on IETF mailing lists. I hope I can help
make the IETF a nicer place for all to work.

I bring an understanding of what people need to get started here, and what
they need to get involved in the technical leadership. The first comes from my
several years of giving the newcomer's tutorials; the second comes from my own
recent experience of being a WG co-chair, both on the "newbie" side, and on
helping to mentor a co-chair when they're the newcomer.

I bring a firm belief in the importance of the IETF's work, and can
passionately advocate for that while also recognizing that we need to
get more people involved in it.

>5.3 Describe how you approach team building in a global volunteer
>organization.

First, things are different now. That is both a problem, but also an
opportunity.  We have all become used to video meetings, which brings its own
issues. Among them is that while a would-be participant could get funding to
attend a one-time IETF meeting, it is probably harder for them ton get
funding for better connectivity for a long period, even if the infrastructure
exists. Because of this saying "we're all doing videoconf now" still leaves
out a pool of contributors. I think we need to make sure we allow, and
perhaps encourage, other "asynchronous" messaging or communication systems.

I have no real doubt that in-person face to face helps make things run more
smoothly, and it's obvious that many of us are eager to be able to get back to
that. My personal experience has been that global teams start best with
in-person meetings, and I don't know how to reconcile that with the current
situation, nor how to think about the issue I raised above.

Perhaps figuring out how to socialize over video will help.  I am not sure.

>5.4 What is your vision for the IETF strategy for the next 5 to 10 years?
>What concrete steps would you take to make that happen? 

Part of what makes this an interesting question, is that the term of
office is two years, although most Chairs serve two or three terms.
Therefore it is hard to 
<tbd>

>5.5 How would you handle conflicts of interest between your personal
>employment or income sources and the interests of the IETF community?

The first step is transparency. For a long time, I have been a believer in
the Justice Louis Brandeis quotation that "If the broad light of day could be
let in upon men's actions, it would purify them as the sun disinfects." When
I was part of OpenSSL's leadership, I created the "policy" section of the
website, and drafted items like the travel policy.

The second step is to avoid conflicts if at all possible. In my case, this
would be making sure I understand the interests of the IETF and Akamai. I
have been involved with the IETF for years (my name first appears in RFC
2616), and employed by Akamai for nearly a decade.  I feel confident saying
that I know what both parties do, how they do it, and what their interests
are.

Should a conflict be discovered, the third step is honest and respectful
discussion. Some type of recusal might be necessary. I cannot speculate on
what specific actions might be required because I cannot imagine any type of
problem arising.

>5.6 What communities and organizations (internal and external) do you 
>consider to be important to IETF?

<tbd>

>5.7 The IETF faces many challenges. What challenges do you think IETF
>will be facing in the coming years, and what approach would you take in
>tackling these challenges?

We need to make sure that the IETF stays relevant and participatory, without
completely giving up on the principals we hold. This can be hard, when
industry or national organizations find other SDO's willing to accomodate
their views, such as weakening the privacy guarantees of TLS, or advocating
for an entirely new Internet protocol that makes it impossible to protect
privacy.

We need to reach out and grow participation, so that in twenty years when the
last attendee of IETF 1 (or IETF 10) has hung up their T-shirt, there's still
many wearing IETF 100, and even more waiting to get IETF 200.  I have tried
to help do that, by founding the first "regional hub" in the Boston area,
and supported others (such as in India) that seem to still be active.

We also need to make sure that we are not overwhelmed or made irrelevant by
our friends.  By this, I mean that a couple-dozen engineers at two or three
companies should not be in the decision to drive the Internet's core
protocols, no more than any company running a root or a "quad-N" DNS server
gets to define DNS.

=============================================================================

>5. IAB Role

>5.1 What do you see as the role of the IETF Chair as an IAB member? What
>activities would you like to pursue in IAB?

I think the IAB is a good place to do longer-term activities. The IETF knows
how to do Working Groups pretty well, but anything else that is focused on
other than protocol documents is difficult.

I would like to see the IAB create more programs, and work to get more
involvement in them by reaching outside its comfort zone.

>5.2 As IETF Chair, understanding the standards ecosystem is important.
>What role do you see the IETF taking in the current Internet ecosystems and
>standards bodies? Which are the key SDOs and consortia that IETF should
>strongly cooperate with and why? What are your thoughts regarding ITU-T
>proposals for creating a new Internet architecture and protocols under 
>the control of ITU?

<tbd>

=============================================================================

>6. IESG Role

>How do you see yourself working with the other Area Directors to coordinate
>work among the different stakeholders, resolve DISCUSS ballots, and deal with
>conflicts or competing interests related to DISCUSS disposition?

<tbd>

=============================================================================

>7. LLC Board Role

>NOTE: RFC 8711 states that one of the LLC Board members shall be filled by 
>the "IETF Chair or delegate selected by the IESG". 

>What do you see as the role of the IESG delegate to the LLC
>Board, in general and relative to funding the IETF, fundraising, building a 
>sustainable funding model, and working with legal counsel to address 
>organization-related legal and compliance issues? If you were the delegate, 
>what experience do you have in these areas?

As described elsewhere in this document, I have worked with a couple of
non-profits. Early on, I read and provide comments (almost always as pull
requests), to every initial policy document of the LLC.

<tbd>

=============================================================================

>8. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

>Is there any other information that you think is relevant to the
>NomCom's deliberation, but is not covered in the above?

If selected, I would do a great job.

It not selected, I hope that I was able to move the transparency needle a
little more.

=============================================================================

>9. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION - NOT FOR CONFIRMING BODY

>Is there any other information you wish to share with the Nominating
>Committee that you do not wish to have shared with the IAB? Such information
>may include opinions or comments about individuals on various IETF leadership
>bodies (I*). It may include opinions about the direction of working groups,
>areas, or leadership bodies. These comments also may include elaborations on
>any of your above answers, if there are further aspects you would like to
>mention that you do not want shared with the IAB.
