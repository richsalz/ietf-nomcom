This repository contains a record of my attempts to get an IETF leadership
position. I tried three times for Security Area Director and was never
picked.  The files `2016-*`, `2017-*`, and `2019-*` document those efforts.
They used to be in separate repositories, but that's not scalable. :)

In 2020 I ran for IETF Chair. The `2020-travel.pdf` file was the current
Chair's list of travel, so I could get budget approval work.

After a few years, I decided to try again for Area Director position. It's
disappointing that most are still white males; that extends to almost
every position that's open this year. :(

I strongly believe in transparency, and therefore I will continue to make
my documents public.  I hope this practice will catch on.

I respect your privacy. If you have something that you wish to keep private,
