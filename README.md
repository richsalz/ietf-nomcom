This repository contains a record of my attempts to get an IETF leadership
position. I tried three times for Security Area Director and was never
picked.  The files `2016-*`, `2017-*`, and `2019-*` document those efforts.
They used to be in separate repositories, but that's not scalable. :)

I strongly believe in transparency, and therefore I will continue to make
my documents public.  I hope this practice will catch on.

I respect your privacy. If you have something that you wish to keep private,
get in touch; my email is on my profile page, <https://github.com/richsalz>.
