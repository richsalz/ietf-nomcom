IAB. Did anyone else notice that?}

One important difference between an AD and a WG Chair, is that the latter
generally avoids expressing technical opinion as a Chair, and will preface
their comments with a saying such as "speaking as an individual." ADs are
different: they are expected to have opinions, and to express them. While
overall cohesion of IETF protocols is important -- and the IAB plays a role
here -- the AD cannot be seen as having a particular "axe to grind." This can
be difficult. As a recent example, how can one provide feedback on a protocol
that uses DNS to provide security information, without giving the impression
of forcing people to use DNSSEC?

It is common to hear ADs say it takes a year to figure out how to do the job
properly. A common explanation is learning how to most effectively spend
one's time. But I wonder if part of it is also learning how to balance WG
consensus against one's personal views?  I think that could be important.

Of course, there is also the need to work well with other members of the
IESG. That should not take a year. If you've ever had to change jobs, then
it should be possible to adapt to new colleagues in a much shorter time
especially given the Zoom expertise we all learned during the pandemic.

I have no reason to doubt the time commitment in the expertise document. I
have a fair amount of experience reading I-Ds; I've been a SECDIR and ARTART
reviewer for several years. I am a fast reader. Even for programming
languages, I prefer to first read a (good) book. I am confident about my
ability to keep up with the required reading.

I have no insight into the other parts of the job. I note, for example, that
there is no discussion in the expertise document about the planning and
organizing of the IETF meetings, any experiments to be held during those
meetings and so on. The expertise document is mostly about WGs and drafts.

I am smart, organized, have good social skills, and not-dissimilar experience
(see below). I will pick things up as I go along. I am confident that if I
find anything unusual, I will report it so that it can be reflected in future
expertise documents. For example, I did it here, I wrote the final report
for RFC 9389, and during my NomCom Chair, I submitted seven errata against
RFC 8713.

>accomplish as an AD, and how do you plan to achieve them?

WIT has only existed for about a year, and I think it's still finding its
way. Just like OPS has two ADs, one focused each on operations and
management, WIT is starting out with one focused on Transport and the other
one Internet protocols (but not the Internet Protocol). It's reasonable to
follow the OPS model; I don't know if that was made explicit to NomCom.
Reading the desired expertise, they want some overlap, but recognize that no
one person will be able to cover all areas in the ARea. I am friendly with
many IETFers, and I can draw on a large body of expertise within Akamai as
well. I will be able to separate their technical advice from Akamai's
corporate position, should that prove necessary.

For myself, I am interested in how secure application-oriented protocols can
be built on top of the common Internet substrate. I do not have specific
suggestions, but my career at the IETF shows that I am heavily invested in
bringing in new participants and helping them be succesful here. As a recent
data point, I am co-Chair of the HTTPAPI working group, which when it started
half of its members had never been to an IETF WG meeting before.

I do not have any specific metrics, such as number of BOFs or WGs that should
be formed over the next year or two, nor how many WGs should be closed. I
look forward to seeing how the GREEN BoF ends up. In the New Participants
tutorial we say that the IETF is a bottoms-up organization, and I do not
think it is incumbent on ADs to think of all ideas. I am confident that if I
am chosen, after a some months of seeing the big picture, at least one idea
will come to me.

>Skills questions: How do your skills and experience contribute to the
success >of the area, and what specific achievements would you bring that fit
the >objectives of the Area?

I know how the IETF works. I have written and contributed to several drafts
and RFCs, and developed code based on standards. I know what makes a good
standard. I am enthusiastic about the IETF, and am patient with those who
want to get something done but seem stuck or need help. I am not interested
in getting my name in the text or on the author list of as many RFCs as
possible.

I have been giving the Newcomer's tutorial for many years, and am frequently
contacted by "alumni" to answer their questions or offer advice on how to do
things.

I don't have solid predictions on what kinds of things will come up -- other
than it's more likely to be based on QUIC than not. But for those who do
present ideas, I can promise an open ear, a dedication to the community, and
advice on how to help them succeed within that community.

I am concerned about the centralization of the browser code-bases. This plays
into WIT because a gating factor that I have often heard mentioned is "if the
browsers don't do it, there's no point." It is incredibly wrong for the
Internet be unduly influenced by a few dozen engineers at a handful of
companies, but I don't know how to address that.

I am not an incumbent.

I have Chaired ACME, CURDLE, and currently co-Chair HTTPAPI. I was NomCom
Chair, we started during the major Covid time period. I co-authored drafts
that would/will update the IETF Process and WG procedures (2026 and 2418,
respectively). I have a forthcoming RFC that updates and clarifies the NTP
registries and correct historical mistakes and I I am one of the Designated
Experts for the TLS Registries. I write this to give background for the
claim I said above: I know how the IETF works, and I explain it to newcomers.

I am on the Governing Board of my Church. I previously ran the day-to-day
operations of the OpenSSL project including its finances. Between those two
organizations, I understand how non-profits work. At OpenSSL I obtained the
clearance from contributors, set up the CLA program, and managed the change
from a proprietary license to the Apache license. I know how copyrights and
IPR works.

I am on my town's $Party Political Committee, participating in
get-out-the-vote operations, holding signs, and so on. I understand the
importance of community involvement.

On the technical front, I have been a recognized contributor to multiple
security groups, notably TLS and LAMPS. I have made several presentations to
GENDISPATCH about IETF structure and practices, most in collaboration with
others. Through HTTPAPI I have learned a great deal about OpenAPI. My
employer is VERY involved with HTTP, QUIC, media over the Internet (among
other things we handle the Olympics and Amazon's Thursday Night (American)
Football). I bring some experience and knowledge to those areas and have been
able to read most recent drafts without confusion. (I am glad OAUTH is not in
this area :)

CDNI will be problematic, and I will work with my co-AD to have them be
responsible for it; I will officially recuse myself from all ballots on CDNI
documents.

>==================================================================

>Participation, Diversity, and Mentoring

>Encouraging Participation: Can you share some examples of how you've encouraged
>new participation in the IETF?

In addition to the new participants briefings, I attend the pre-meeting
planing sessions, and the post-meeting wrap-ups. I participate in the
Education and Outreach Directorate (EODIR). I co-Chair the WGChairs lunch,
where we've had education and info-sharing sessions. I founded the
Boston-area IETF hub, which unfortunately never recovered from Covid (we had
a couple of meetings a year until that became untenable).

>Building Future Leadership: What steps have you taken (or plan to take if newly
>selected) to cultivate a diverse and capable group of individuals who could step
>into AD role in the future?

A WG Chair is the stepping-stone to other leadership positions within the
IETF, and WG Chairs are appointed by the ADs. As a non-AD, I don't think
there is very much one can do. I have expressed my frustration to various
ADs about the "centralization" of WG Chairs. Roman and Deb might be able to
talk to that. Beyond that, there is little I can do. The most important part
of the pipeline is the ADs selecting WG Chairs.

In each of ACME and HTTPAPI I trained a co-Chair. I also helped my successor
in ACME understand the job, if only because the timezone distance was zero,
compared to their co-Chair. I have tried to encourage people to write
Shepherd documents to see what is important when an I-D leaves the WG, but
rarely succeeded.

I solicited several people to try for various AD roles, including IETF Chair,
both as NomCom Chair and since then. I have submitted my name for NomCom
membership every time I was eligible (i.e., when not under consideration
myself).

As an AD, when I am introduced to each of the WG's for which I am
responsible, I would make a point of telling the room "if you are interested
in being a Chair, please let me know."  I would repeat that on the WG mailing
list. Privately, I would ask each Chair how long they've had the role, and
any current and previous Chair positions. I would then strongly encourage
long-serving Chairs to nominate a successor and resign. A hallway
conversation with Roman makes me think he would support this kind of thing,
but I would first discuss the last part within the IESG.

The DataTracker needs to keep track of individual longevity better. Perhaps
Colin Perkins's research group has some ideas, or RASPRG which I have
attended. I will be following-up both in November.

>Diversity in the IETF: How do you envision diversity within the IETF, and how
>well do you think the current level of participation aligns with that vision?

We are not as good as we should be. Even discounting the numbers, the reports
from the recent survey of how women are treated[1] -- interviews of 31
women -- is incredibly disheartening.

One thing I've learned is that you cannot come into a new group and
expect to be able to present all the answers. You have to come in and listen.
It's great to see Systers being part of EODIR meetings. Perhaps we can get
some ideas from them.

{I assume the duplication is a cut and paste error, and the first two lines
are the old ones.}

The first item is that the IETF needs to fix itself. According to various
statistics (Forbes, Statista, others), around 2/3 of the world's 8billion
population use the Internet. What do they want and need?  We don't know.
From its beginning, the IETF was mostly populated by academics and engineers
at US-based networking companies. As the IETF has become more globally-based,
North America still dominates attendance [1] and Africa, South America, and
Oceania have remained essentially flat.

What do those areas need, in terms of the IETF scope of work? I don't know,
and I doubt there are more than a handful in the IETF who would be willing to
even hazard a guess.

Not only is the IETF not very representational of the World, our membership
appears to becoming ossified. Look at Colin Perkins paper on time-based
participation [2]. Figure 5a is particularly frightening. Of the most popular
US technology companies (FAANG is the outdated term), all of whom owe their
existance to the Internet, one third do not participate.

There is no second item. A particular effort to encourage new work is not
needed. In fact, it runs the risk of increasing centralization and over-work
for the existing community. New work will continue coming to the IETF
organically, as it always has. Instead, we should work to make sure that the
IETF, which prides itself on being a bottom-up organization, where
participation can be done solely via email, does a much better job of
representing everyone. I would encourage the IETF technical and
administrative leadership to brainstorm on ways to make this happen.
