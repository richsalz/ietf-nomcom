There are also other GitHub organizations and repositories for IETF
documents I've worked on.

The introductory matter says the confirming body is the IESG. Don't you mean
the IAB? Did anyone else notice that?

One important difference between an AD and a WG Chair, is that the latter
generally avoids expressing technical opinion as a chair, such as prefacing
comments by saying "with no hat on." ADs are different, and are expected to
have opinions, and to express them. While overall cohesion of IETF protocols
is important, the AD cannot be seen as having a particular "axe to grind."
This can be difficult. As a recent example, how can one provide feedback on a
protocol that uses DNS to provide security information, without giving
the impression of forcing people to use DNSSEC?

It is common for ADs to say it takes a year to figure out how to do the
job properly. Usually, the point raised is about how to most effectively spend
your time. But I wonder if part of it is also learning how to balance WG
consensus against one's personal views?  I think that could be important.

Of course, there is also the need to work well with other members of the IESG.
I do not believe that takes the first year. If you've ever had to change
jobs, then it should be possible to adapt to new colleagues in a much shorter
time.

I have no reason to doubt the time commitment in the expertise document. I
have a fair amount of experience reading I-Ds; I've been a SECDIR and ARTART
reviewer for several years. I am a fast reader. Even for programming
languages, I prefer to first read a (good) book. I am confident about my
ability to keep up with the required reading.

I have no insight into the other part of the job. I am smart, organized, have
good social skills, and not-dissimilar experience (see below). I will pick
things up as I go along. I am confident that if I find anything unusual, I
will report it so that it can be reflected in future expertise documents.
For example, I wrote the final report for RFC 9389, and during my NomCom
Chair, I submitted seven errata against RFC 8713 (no other submissions).

I will note, for example, that there is no discussion in the expertise
document about the planning and organizing of the IETF meetings, and any
experiments to be held during those meetings. In fact, the expertise
is almost all about WGs an drafts.

WIT has only existed for about a year, and I think it's still finding its
way.  Just like OPS has two ADs, one focused each on operations and
management, WIT is starting out with one focused on Transport and the other
one Internet protocols (but not the Internet Protocol). It's reasonable to
follow the OPS model; I don't know if that was made explicit to NomCom.
Reading the desired expertise, they want some overlap, but recognize that no
one person will cover all areas of that protocol stack. I am friendly with
many IETFers, and I can draw on a large body of expertise within Akamai as well.
I will be able to separate their technical advice from Akamai's corporate
position, if that proves to be necessary.

For myself, I am interested in how secure application-oriented protocols can
be built on top of the common Internet substrate. I do not have specific
suggestions, but my career at the IETF shows that I am heavily invested in
bringing in new participants and helping them be succesful here. As a recent
data point, I am co-chair of the HTTPAPI working group, which when it started
half of its members had never been to an IETF WG meeting before.

I do not have any specific metrics, such as number of BOFs or WGs that should
be formed over the next year or two, nor how many WGs should be closed.

>Skills questions: How do your skills and experience contribute to the success

>objectives of the Area?

I know how the IETF works. I have written and contributed to several drafts
and RFCs, and developed code based on standards. I know what makes a good
standard. I am enthusiastic about the IETF, and am fairly patient with those
who want to get something done but seem stuck or need help. I am not
interested in getting my name in the text or on the author list of as many
RFCs as possible.

I have been giving the Newcomer's tutorial for many years, and am frequently
contacted by "alumni" to answer their questions or offer advice on how to do
things.

I don't have solid predictions on what kinds of things will come up -- other
than it's more likely to be based on QUIC than not. But for those who do
present ideas, I can promise an open ear, a dedication to the community, and
advice on how to help them succeed within that community.

I am concerned about the centralization of the browser codebases. This plays
into WIT because a gating factor that I have often heard mentioned is "if the
browsers don't do it, what's the point." It is incredibly wrong for Internet
be unduly influenced by a few dozen engineers at a handful of companies, but I
don't know how to address that.

I have chaired ACME, CURDLE, and currently co-chair HTTPAPI. I was NomCom
chair, we operated during the major covid time period. I co-authored drafts
that would/will update the IETF Process and WG procedures (2026 and 2418,
respectively), and have a forthcoming RFC that updates and clarifies the NTP
registries and correct historical mistakes; I am also one of the Designated
Experts for the TLS Registries.  I am writing this to give background for the
claim I said above: I know how the IETF works, and I explain it to newcomers.

I am on the Governing Board of my Church.  I previously ran the day-to-day
financial operations of the OpenSSL project. Between those two organizations,
I understand how non-profits work. At OpenSSL I obtained the clearance from
contributors, set up the CLA program, and managed the change from a
proprietary license to the Apache license. I know how copyrights and IPR
works.

I am on the town Political Committee, participating in get-out-the-vote
operations, holding signs, and so on. I understand the importance of
community inolvement.

On the technical front, I have been a recognized contributor to multiple
security groups, notably TLS and LAMPS. I have made several presentations to
GENDISPATCH about IETF structure and practices, most in collaboration with
others. Through HTTPAPI I have learned a great deal about OpenAPI. My
employer is VERY involved with HTTP, QUIC, media over the Internet (among
other things we handle the Olympics and Amazon's Thursday Night (American)
Football). I bring some experience and knowledge to those areas and have
been able to read most recent drafts without confusion. (I am glad OAUTH
is not in this area :)

CDNI will be problematic, and I will work with my co-AD to have them be
responsible for it; I will officially recuse myself from all ballots
on CDNI documents.

>==================================================================

>Participation, Diversity, and Mentoring

>Encouraging Participation: Can you share some examples of how you've encouraged
>new participation in the IETF?

In addition to the new participants briefings, I participate in the Education
and Outreach Directorate (EODIR). I co-chair the WGChairs lunch, where we've
had education and info-sharing sessions. I founded the Boston-area IETF hub,
which unfortunately never recovered from Covid (we had a couple of meetings
a year until that became untenable).

>Building Future Leadership: What steps have you taken (or plan to take if newly
>selected) to cultivate a diverse and capable group of individuals who could step
>into AD role in the future?

A WG chair is the stepping-stone to other leadership positions within the
IETF, and WG chairs are appointed by the ADs. As a non-AD, I don't think
there is very much one can do, other than point out issues.

In each of ACME and HTTPAPI I trained a co-chair. I also helped my successor
in ACME understand the job, if only because the timezone distance was zero,
compared to their co-chair.  I have tried to encourage people to write
Shepherd documenrts to see what is important when an I-D leaves the WG, but
rarely succeeded.

I solicited several people to try for various AD roles, including IETF Chair,
both as NomCom chair and since then. I have submitted my name for NomCom
membership every time I was eligible (i.e., when not under consideration
myself).

I have expressed my frustration to various ADs about the "centralization" of
WG chairs. Roman and Deb might be able to talk to that.  Beyond that, there
is little I can do. The most important part of the pipeline is the ADs
selecting WG chairs.

As an AD, when I am introduced to each of the WG's for which I am responsible,
I would make a point of telling the room "if you are interested in being a
Chair, please let me know."  I would repeat that on the WG mailing list
the following week. I would ask each chair how long they've had the job, and
all current/previous chairs. I would then strongly encourage long-serving
chairs to nominate a successor and resign. A hallway conversation with the
current IETF Chair makes me think he would support this kind of thing.

The DataTracker tooling needs to keep track of individual longevity better.
Perhaps Colin Perkins's study group has some ideas, or RASPRG which I have
attended. I will be following-up both in November.

>Diversity in the IETF: How do you envision diversity within the IETF, and how
>well do you think the current level of participation aligns with that vision?

We are not as good as we should be. Even discounting the numbers, the reports
from the recent survey of how women are treated -- anecdotes from the women
themselves -- is incredibly disheartening.

One thing I've learned is that you cannot come into a new group and be, to
use the cliche, "the great white savior." You have to come in and listen.
It's great to see Systers being part of EODIR meetings. Perhaps we can get
some ideas from them.

I am confident that anyone can see that I have been consistent on the main
